        BUG


            when saving a lesion's owner in upload a lesion
            if he didnt upload avatar yet, lesion card wont have avatar
            even if he uploaded an avatar after that

            profile settings, update profile info when uploading avatar and when updating info

        THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
            make a backend route were admin get all uploaded lesions without personel information
            CASCADE delete in database when delete my account or not we can use new data in training set
